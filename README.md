# Zane's CV

**I kind of got tired of doing this locally, so I moved my CV to Overleaf. I haven't been motivated enough to figure out how to link overleaf and GH yet.**

This repo contains my Curriculum Vitae in two formats.

* TeX: I originally wrote my CV in LaTeX in a modular format.
* ASCII: I am working on converting my CV into ASCII format once a friend in
computer science convinced me this would be useful (draft).
